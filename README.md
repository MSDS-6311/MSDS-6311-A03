Assignment 3

## Problem 1: Regular expressions 1.
Review the program `list_tags.py` included with this assignment.  It reads the file `/home/shared/Tweets.csv` and prints hashtags from it. 

* Modify it so that it will only print unique tags, skipping duplicates.
* Notice that the program misses some hashtags because it does not match tags containing digits. Modify the program so that it will match all valid Twitter hashtags.


## Problem 2. Regular expressions 2.
Write a new program, `list_love_tags.py` that lists all unique hasthags containing the word "love", ignoring case. To verify, I got 44 matches.

 
## Problem 3: SiteZeus business model
In the same folder, create the file `BusinessModel.md`. Using the [markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), write a 1000-1500 word description of how SiteZeus uses big data to create value for their customers.

1. What problem does SiteZeus address?  What did customers do before solutions like SiteZeus existed?
2. What data sources does the platform use?
3. How does the platform transform the data to make it useful for its subscribers?
4. What technical challenges does the company need to solve to make their service effective?
